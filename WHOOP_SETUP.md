# ðŸš€ WHOOP API V1 Integration Setup Guide

Your WHOOP V1 API integration is ready! This version uses the latest V1 endpoints for maximum compatibility and performance.

## Step 1: Create Your WHOOP Developer App

1. Go to [WHOOP Developer Portal](https://developer.whoop.com/)
2. Log in with your WHOOP account
3. Click "Create App"
4. Fill out the form:
   - **App Name**: `Camilo's Portfolio Analytics`
   - **Privacy Policy**: Your portfolio URL (e.g., `https://camilomartinez.co`)
   - **Redirect URIs**: Add BOTH of these:
     - `http://localhost:3002/api/auth/callback/whoop` (for testing)
     - `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/whoop` (for production)
   - **Scopes**: Select all `read:*` permissions for V1 API:
     - `read:recovery`
     - `read:cycles`
     - `read:sleep`
     - `read:workout`
     - `read:profile`
     - `read:body_measurement`

5. **Save your credentials** - you'll get a Client ID and Client Secret

## Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```bash
WHOOP_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
WHOOP_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
AUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_here
POSTGRES_URL=your_neon_database_url_here
```

**Generate AUTH_SECRET**: Use this site: https://generate-secret.vercel.app/

## Step 3: Set Up Database

1. Create a Neon PostgreSQL database
2. Run the database schema from `database-schema.sql`
3. Add your `POSTGRES_URL` to environment variables

## Step 4: Test Locally

1. Restart your dev server: `pnpm dev`
2. Go to `http://localhost:3002/my-stats`
3. Click "Connect WHOOP Account" if needed
4. Log in with your WHOOP credentials
5. Use the data collector: `POST http://localhost:3002/api/whoop-collector`
6. You should see your analytics dashboard with real data!

## Step 5: Deploy to Production

1. Add the same environment variables to Vercel:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard > Your Project > Settings > Environment Variables
   - Add all four variables
2. Update your WHOOP app redirect URI to match your production domain
3. Deploy and test!
