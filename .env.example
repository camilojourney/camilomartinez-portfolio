# WHOOP API Integration Environment Variables
#
# You need to set these environment variables for the WHOOP integration to work:
#
# 1. Get your WHOOP credentials from: https://developer.whoop.com/
# 2. Create a new app with these redirect URLs:
#    - http://localhost:3002/api/auth/callback/whoop (for development)
#    - https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/whoop (for production)
# 3. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret
# 4. Generate a random string for AUTH_SECRET (32+ characters)

# Add these to your .env.local file (create if it doesn't exist):
WHOOP_CLIENT_ID=your_whoop_client_id_here
WHOOP_CLIENT_SECRET=your_whoop_client_secret_here
AUTH_SECRET=your_random_32_character_secret_here

# Example AUTH_SECRET generation:
# You can use this online: https://generate-secret.vercel.app/

# For production (Vercel), add these same variables to:
# Vercel Dashboard > Project > Settings > Environment Variables
